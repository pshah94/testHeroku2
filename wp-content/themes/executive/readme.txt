Executive supports the Portfolio content type from Jetpack. Once this portfolio content type is activated, you can start publishing portfolio content. To display the content, you'll need to create a page called 'Work' and under 'Page Attributes' choose the portfolio page template.

== Setup ==

Create a new page called 'Home'. Under the 'Page Attributes' module, select the 'Front Page' page template and publish. Next create a page called 'Blog' and publish. From here, go to Settings Reading and choose your Front page and Posts page and click the update button when done.

Next: Go to Appearance > Customize > Executive options. This section lets you select your featured pages for your homepage template. Be sure to Save and Publish once you have updated the customizer.

== Social Navigation ==

Executive does support social links in the footer. To add them, simply create a new menu in your WordPress dashboard, add custom links to your profile, for example: https://twitter.com/diversethemes. Be sure to choose the 'social' display option and save any changes. Our themes support most popular social networks.
